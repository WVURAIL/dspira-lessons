Hello.

Mixyll (Minimal version of [Pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll)) is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll based on the popular Jekyll theme [Pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll) by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.
