A software defined radio (SDR) is needed for digitizing the radio signal to feed into the spectrometer program.

Options:

+ The SDR we prefer is the [Airspy R2](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2), $169. This operates in a 10 MHz bandwidth and is the SDR that the DSPIRA software is coded for.

+ A less expensive option is the [Airspy Mini](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2), $99. It operates in a 6 MHz bandwidth. Only a minor adjustment to the software is needed if this SDR is used. Contact us for more information about the changes that would need to be done.

+ RTL-SDR - will need to make a minor change in the source block in the Gnuradio program.

+ Lime - will need to make a minor change in the source block in the Gnuradio program.

+ ADALM-PLUTO - will need to make a minor change in the source block in the Gnuradio program.

For details on the changes needed in the source block, refer to the [spectrometer page here](https://wvurail.org//dspira-lessons/tba??).

Needed for connecting:

+ A [coaxial cable](https://www.coaxrf.com/shop/1-rf-coaxial-cables/times-microwave-lmr240/sma-male-times-microwave-lmr240/lmr240-sma-male-to-sma-male-coaxial-rf-pigtail-cable/) is needed to connect the LNA to the SDR. Typically a 10 ft length is adequate, but any lengthÂ up to 25 ft should work fine.
