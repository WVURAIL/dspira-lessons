This is meant to be a fairly intense sequence of activities for High School+ level students with the goal of eventually taking measurements with the DSPIRA Radio Horn Telescope to determine the Earths Speed around the Sun. The reference point to measure this speed with be the Center of the Galaxy.

There are (up to) 6 activities to get to using the Horn Telescope

_Activity List_
   1. How Fast Are We Moving?
   2. Modeling Earth's Motion Around the Sun
   3. Earth's Motion With Respect to Galactic Center
   4. A teacher created Doppler Effect Lesson -(Currently, no DSPIRA Activity here)
   5. Analyzing DSPIRA Radio Horn Data
   6. Comparing Model to Data
   7. Getting your own data with your Radio Horn
   
 ## How Fast Are We Moving?
   [How Fast Are We Moving?](http://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/HowFastAreWeMoving)  
   This activity is a stand alone activity that is a good simple exercise for students from general middle school space science up to high school physics students
    to determine the speed of the Earth's rotation, revolution around the Sun, and the Sun's speed around the Galaxy.
    
 ## Modeling Earth's Motion around the Sun 
   The Earth will be modeled as moving in a circle around the Sun.  The direction to the Center of the Galaxy is also included becuase it will eventually be needed for the 
   measurements
