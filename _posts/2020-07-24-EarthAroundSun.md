title: "Measuring the Earth's Speed around the Sun"
summary:  This is a multi-activity lesson leading towards measuring the Speed of the Earth around the Sun
tags: ['School-Teachers', 'Students', 'Hobbyists' ]

This is a fairly intense sequence of activities for High School+ level students with the goal of eventually taking measurements with the DSPIRA Radio Horn Telescope to determine the Earths Speed around the Sun. The reference point to measure this speed with be the Center of the Galaxy (GC).   
### Click here for a complete document of [Teacher's Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10zVMqpykbRbOjKvXGvWoZxYcacZ31Ay5AIp2mx70VOk/edit) for this whole activity sequence

There are (up to) 6 activities to get to using the Horn Telescope 


_Activity List_
   1. How Fast Are We Moving?
   2. Modeling Earth's Motion Around the Sun
   3. Earth's Motion With Respect to Galactic Center
   4. A teacher created Doppler Effect Lesson -(Currently, no DSPIRA Activity here)
   5. Analyzing DSPIRA Radio Horn Data
   6. Comparing Model to Data
   7. Getting your own data with your Radio Horn
   
 ## How Fast Are We Moving?   
   To get to the activity files, click here [How Fast Are We Moving?](http://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/HowFastAreWeMoving)  
   This activity is a stand alone activity that is a good simple exercise for students from general middle school space science up to high school physics students
    to determine the speed of the Earth's rotation, revolution around the Sun, and the Sun's speed around the Galaxy.
    
 ## Modeling Earth's Motion around the Sun   Done 
   The Earth will be modeled as moving in a circle around the Sun.  The direction to the Center of the Galaxy(GC) is also included becuase it will eventually be needed for the 
   measurements.  Since the amount of the Earth's motion towards the GC is eventually needed for Doppler considerations, a graphical approach to velocity vector components is 
   used here.
