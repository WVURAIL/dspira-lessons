This is meant to be a fairly intense sequence of activities for High School+ level students with the goal of eventually taking measurements with the DSPIRA Radio Horn Telescope to determine the Earths Speed around the Sun.

There are (up to) 6 activities to get to using the Horn Telescope

_Activity List_
   1. How Fast Are We Moving?
   2. Modeling Earth's Motion Around the Sun
   3. Earth's Motion With Respect to Galactic Center
   4. A teacher created Doppler Effect Lesson -(Currently, no DSPIRA Activity here)
   5. Analyzing DSPIRA Radio Horn Data
   6. Comparing Model to Data
   7. Getting your own data with your Radio Horn
   
   [How Fast Are We Moving?](http://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/HowFastAreWeMoving)
   This activity is a stand alone activity that is a good simple exercise for students from general middle school space science up to high school physics students
