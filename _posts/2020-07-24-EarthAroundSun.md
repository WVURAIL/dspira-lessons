title: "Measuring the Earth's Speed around the Sun"
summary:  This is a multi-activity lesson leading towards measuring the Speed of the Earth around the Sun
tags: ['School-Teachers', 'Students', 'Hobbyists' ]
categories: ['Astronomy','Earths Speed around Sun']

This is a fairly intense sequence of activities for High School+ level students with the goal of eventually taking measurements with the DSPIRA Radio Horn Telescope to determine the Earths Speed around the Sun. The reference point to measure this speed with be the Center of the Galaxy (GC).

There are (up to) 6 activities to get to using the Horn Telescope 


**_Activity List_**
   1. How Fast Are We Moving?
   2. Modeling Earth's Motion Around the Sun
   3. Earth's Motion With Respect to Galactic Center
   4. A teacher created Doppler Effect Lesson -(Currently, no DSPIRA Activity here)
   5. Analyzing DSPIRA Radio Horn Data
   6. Comparing Model to Data
   7. Getting your own data with your Radio Horn
   
## How Fast Are We Moving?   
   This activity is a stand alone activity that is a good simple exercise for students from general middle school space science up to high school physics students
   to determine the speed of the Earth's rotation, revolution around the Sun, and the Sun's speed around the Galaxy.

## Modeling Earth's Motion around the Sun    
The Earth will be modeled as moving in a circle around the Sun.  The direction to the Center of the Galaxy(GC) is also included becuase it will eventually be needed for the 
   measurements.  Since the amount of the Earth's motion towards the GC is eventually needed for Doppler considerations, a graphical approach to velocity vector components is 
   used here.

## Earth's Motion with respect to the Galactic Center 
The Earth's Orbit Model generated in the last activity is fine, but the Day #'s in the activity need to be tagged to an actual calandar date.  This activity uses the online 
planetarium program [Stellarium Web Online](https://stellarium-web.org/) to help connect the calendar to the student's model they created.

### Stellarium - Web vs Download Version  
Stellarium is a great application for anyone wishing to look at the night sky, or for teachers wanting students to learn about the sky through an interactive experience.  
If you get into the full DSPIRA Experience with making and using a Radio Horn Telescope, you would probably want to take the longer learning path to the more robust environment of the downloadable version (still currently free).  Watch the video for a DSPIRA opinion on Pros and Cons for each version.
