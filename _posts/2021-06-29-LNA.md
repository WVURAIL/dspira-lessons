The low noise amplifier (LNA), which is a critical component of the horn telescope, is needed to amplify the extremely weak radio signals detected by the antenna. This component must be placed as close as possible to the antenna probe to reduce the amplification of any noise that could be picked up during the processing of the signals. It connects to the antenna probe at the can through a standard SMA connector.

Options:

+ [DSPIRA LNA](http://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/DetailedLNAInstructions) - designed by Professor Kevin Bandura at WVU to operate in urban environments. The total cost to build this LNA circuit is approximately $60. Details on ordering the parts and instructions on how to solder the circuit can be found [here](http://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/DetailedLNAInstructions). The gerbers files for fabricating this circuit on your own can be found [here](https://github.com/WVURAIL/os_radio_astro_hw).
