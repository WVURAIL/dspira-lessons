The LNA) connects to the antenna probe through a standard SMA connector that is part of the can assembly. Professor Kevin Bandura at WVU designed the DSPIRA 1420 MHz LNA to operate in urban environments. The total cost to build this LNA circuit is approximately $60. Details on ordering the parts and instructions on how to solder the circuit are provided [here.](http://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/DetailedLNAInstructions) 
	
A pre-made LNA circuit can be used if preferred. The options listed below will work with the DSPIRA horn telescope and software.
