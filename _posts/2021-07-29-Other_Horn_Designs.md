**Baby DSPIRA Horn** - A smaller version of the design presented above can be found in a [pdf here](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/FilesUploaded/MiniHorn_construction.pdf) and in [videos here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSg3s3C3JCH2yBC_kHLGCpd0tqQ6gM1h). This includes a cradle and stand as part of its construction. This design operates using all of the other components and software used with the standard DSPIRA horn described within this webpage. It provides easy use and is good for demonstrations.
