*    This will install the spectrometer program *spectrometer_w_cal.grc*.

Complete the following steps:

   1. Open a terminal window in Ubuntu.

   2. Install gnuradio external python dependencies and SDR drivers by typing the following and hit enter:
   ```
      sudo apt install gnuradio gr-osmosdr airspy python3-h5py python3-ephem git cmake liborc-0.4-dev -y
   ```
   3. To clone the repository: in the terminal, type and Enter: `git clone https://github.com/WVURAIL/gr-radio_astro.git`

   4. Switch to the gr-radio_astro directory: `cd gr-radio_astro`

   5. Switch to the gr-radio_astro 3.8 branch by typing: `git checkout gr38`

   6. Make a build directory: `mkdir build`, and then move to it: `cd build`  
      
   7. Then run the following in the build directory:

      ```
      cmake ..
      sudo make
      sudo make install
      ```
**Additional Steps for setting the proper Python environment:**

   9. Open a terminal window.
   
   10. Make sure you are at the home directory (type and Enter `cd` ). Then type `gedit .bashrc` to open the *.bashrc* file in an editor.
   
   11. Scroll to the very bottom of this file, add a blank line, and then copy and paste the following code: `export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages:$PYTHONPATH`

   12. Save and close (x in upper right corner).
   
   13. Additionally you can create appropriate symbolic links
       1.  Check which python is the installed version of GNURadio by opening  `gnuradio-companion` in a terminal window and click on `Help --> About` and noting the python version on the dialog box that open.  
       2.  Go to the following by typing: `cd /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages` or `cd /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages` for the appropriate python version. 
       3.  Type `ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages/radio_astro`   
 
**Check that the Installation was Successful**

   1.  *Restart your terminal window*. Run the program in Gnuradio:
         - In a terminal window type `gnuradio-companion`
         - Open the *spectrometer_w_cal.grc* program as follows: 
            
           `File --> Open --> gr-radio_astros --> examples --> *spectrometer_w_cal.grc* `
         - Plug an Airspy radio, with the LNA attached, into the USB port. Run the program by hitting the start triangle ("execute the flowgraph") on the menu bar at top. If no errors occur, you are all set!  
   
#### How to Update files from the gr-radio_astro gr38 Repository

   1. Open the terminal window.
      
   2. From your home directory (cd ), go to the gr-radio_astro folder: `cd gr-radio_astro`
   
   3. Type `git status`. Check the "On branch ..." statement at the top. You want to be in the gr38 branch. To get there, type `git checkout gr38`.

   4. If a warning message shows up about local changes made that could overwrite files, type `git stash`.

   5. Type `git status` to check that you are "On branch gr38".

   6. Type `git pull`. 
      - If a warning message shows up about local changes made that could overwrite files, type `git stash`. 
      - Then type `git pull` again.

   7. Change to the `build` directory: `cd build`

   8. Type `rm -rf *`. NOTE: Make sure you are in the `build` directory before typing `rm -rf *`!

   9. Then run the following:
         ```
      cmake ..
      sudo make
      sudo make install
      ```

   10. The update is complete.

   
   **To Run the __spectrometer_w_cal.grc__ program in Gnuradio After Updating:**
   
   1. In a terminal window type `gnuradio-companion`.

   2. Close any previous version of `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` that might be open in Gnuradio.
   
   3. Open the new version of `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` from the folder `/gr-radio_astro/examples/`
            
      - under `File` select `Open`; 
      - Navigate to the` gr-radio_astro` folder.
      - Under `examples` open `DSPIRA`; then select `spectrometer_w_cal.grc`.

   4. Connect an Airspy SDR to a USB port, and start the program running (Hit the black triangle at the top middle ribbon bar.)
