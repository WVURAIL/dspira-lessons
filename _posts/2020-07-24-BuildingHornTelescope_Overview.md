A list of the components that are needed to build and operate a horn radio telescope system is presented below. Links to documentation and instructional videos are provided where applicable.

### What's Needed for a Complete Horn Telescope System
   - the horn & antenna assembly – details provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdc5lhKErFyIsc8b52ZIkCPJLi-XykSb/view?usp=sharing)

      * the horn
      * the antenna can
      * the antenna probe
      * the antenna feedthrough
      * the horn support stand

   - a low noise amplifier (LNA)
   
       All of the following work fine for use with the horn telescope. The DSPIRA LNA is the most stable and long lasting.

      * Best option: the DSPIRA LNA – see information and instructions [link]
      * Next best option: [Nooelec SAWbird+ H1](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-addons/sawbird-h1.html) - Premium SAW Filter & Cascaded Ultra-Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) Module for Hydrogen Line (21cm) Applications
      * Next best option: [Radio Astronomy Hydrogen Line Low Noise Amplifier](https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/radio-astronomy-hydrogen-line-low-noise-amplifier/) 

   - an Airspy Software Defined Radio: [Airspy R2](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2) 

   - coaxial cable with SMA connectors: from coaxrf.com, [LMR195 SMA MALE to SMA MALE Coaxial RF Pigtail Cable](https://www.coaxrf.com/shop/1-rf-coaxial-cables/times-microwave-lmr195/sma-male-times-microwave-lmr195/lmr195-sma-male-to-sma-male-coaxial-rf-pigtail-cable-2/)

   - computer & software needs

      * computer with a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system

         + install Gnuradio 3.8

         + install the program *spectrometer_w_cal.grc* from the Github repository gr-radio_astro


      * computer with Windows operating system - the Gnuradio and spectrometer_w_cal.grc program can be run from a bootable flash drive

      * computer with Mac operating system - the Gnuradio and spectrometer_w_cal.grc program can be run from a bootable flash drive
