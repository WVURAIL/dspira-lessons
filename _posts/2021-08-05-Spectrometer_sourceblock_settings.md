The default source block settings in the `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` GNURadio program are for the [Airspy R2](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2) SDR. If a different SDR is used, changes in the source block and the `samp_rate Variable` block may be needed. The settings for some common SDR's used with the horn telescopes are described below.

Options:

+ The [Airspy Mini](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2)

    - Source block: the `osmocom Source` block is used; the "Device Arguments" are the same as for the Airspy R2. So no changes are needed in this block.

    - `samp_rate Variable` block: This block is in the upper left corner of the canvas in the `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` program next to the `Options` block. Open this block by double-clicking it. Change the "Value" to "6e6" (which is 6 MHz).

+ RTL-SDR

    - Source block: Change the "Device Argument" to: rtl=0, bias=1, pack=0, as shown:

    - `samp_rate Variable` block: This block is in the upper left corner of the canvas in the `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` program next to the `Options` block. Open this block by double-clicking it. Change the "Value" to "2.4e6" (which is 2.4 MHz).

+ Lime 

    - Source block: the Lime uses the `LimeSDR Source (RX)` block. Click on the `osmocom` block and hit Delete. Then in the search window on the tool bar at the top, type "LimeSDR". Grab the `LimeSDR Source (RX)` and drag it onto the canvas where the `osmocom` block was. Then one-by-one connect the blue output of the `LimeSDR Source (RX)` block to the `Stream to Vector` block, the three `Delay` blocks, and the `Complex to Real`. The final connections should look like the following:

    <img align="center" width="239" height="164" src="/dspira-lessons/images/Lime_connections.png">
 
    - Open the `LimeSDR Source (RX)` block (by double-clicking) and set the following:
        - On the "General" tab, set "RF frequency" to "freq" [without the quotes], and check that the "Sample rate" is "samp_rate" [without the quotes]. "Channel" should be on "A" [without the quotes].

        <img align="center" width="297" height="265" src="/dspira-lessons/images/Lime_General.png">


        - The settings on the Channel A tab should be as shown:

        <img src="/dspira-lessons/images/Lime_channelA.png" align="center" width="500px"/>
        
    - `samp_rate Variable` block: The Lime SDR can use a 10 MHz samp_rate; so no change is needed in this block.

    - POWER TO THE LNA: The Lime SDR does not power the LNA. Therefore, it is necessary that external power is provided to the LNA. This is done through a [bias-T](https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=ZFBT-282-1.5A%2B), which is connected to the LNA and Lime as shown:

        An [SMA female to female connector/adapter](https://www.data-alliance.net/sma-female-to-sma-female-adapter-coupler-gender-changer/) will be needed for the connection from the bias-T to the LNA cable, as indicated in the diagram above.

+ ADALM-PLUTO 

    - The Adalm-Pluto SDR uses the `PlutoSDRSource` block that will need to be installed. Complete the [steps outlined here](https://wvurail.org//dspira-lessons/PlutoSDR_installation) to install this block on your computer.

    - Source block: the Adalm-Pluto uses the `PlutoSDRSource` block. Click on the `osmocom` block and hit Delete. Then in the search window on the tool bar at the top, type "PlutoSDR". Grab the `PlutoSDRSource` and drag it onto the canvas where the `osmocom` block was. Then one-by-one connect the blue output of the `PlutoSDRSource` block to the `Stream to Vector` block, the three `Delay` blocks, and the `Complex to Real`. The final connections should look like the following:

    <img align="center" width="277" height="237" src="/dspira-lessons/images/PlutoSDR_sourceBlock_connections.png">

    - Open the `PlutoSDRSource` block (by double-clicking) and set the following:
        - On the "General" tab, set the values as shown:

        <img align="center" width="300" height="267" src="/dspira-lessons/images/PlutoSDR_Source.png">

    - The `samp_rate` and `freq` Variable blocks should be set to the values shown:

**Cable Hardware:** A [coaxial cable](https://www.coaxrf.com/shop/1-rf-coaxial-cables/times-microwave-lmr240/sma-male-times-microwave-lmr240/lmr240-sma-male-to-sma-male-coaxial-rf-pigtail-cable/) is needed to connect the LNA to the SDR. Typically a 10 ft length is adequate, but any lengthÂ up to 25 ft should work fine.
