- Installation of any of the following software options will allow the user to run the spectrometer program to operate the horn telescope equipped with an LNA, software defined radio (Airspy or equivalent), and the proper cables. See the document [What is Needed to Build a Horn Telescope](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/BuildingHornTelescope_Overview) and links therein for more details about the telescope system.

- Different options for operating the horn telescope spectrometer program, *spectrometer_w_cal.grc*, are presented here. The options provided vary depending on the user's computer system and his or her comfort level working with computers.

The options presented below include a brief description of the system requirements and what is involved in the installation process.

1. [Download a fully operating image onto a flash drive that can be operated from most computer systems.](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/Install_Ubuntu_spectrometer_onFlashdrive)

    - Easiest for those who are the less experienced in operating computer systems.

    - Requires a computer and a 32 GB, 3.0 USB flash drive. 

    - Once the flash drive image is created, the spectrometer program can be run from the following systems:

        - pc with Windows: minimum system specs?, brand names?

        - MAC with OS ?? or higher

        - Linux system, such as one running Ubuntu 20.04.

        - The software needed is free

    - Click [here](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/Install_Ubuntu_spectrometer_onFlashdrive) for installation instructions.
    
2. [Install the free & open-source software, *GnuRadio*, on a Linux system operating Ubuntu 20.04.](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/BuildingHorn_SoftwareInfo)

    - This option is for those who are more experienced with computers and feel comfortable installing software on a hard drive.

    - Requires a computer that either runs Ubuntu on it, or has a hard drive running Windows that can be partitioned.

    - It may require partitioning a hard drive in Windows and installing Ubuntu 20.04 on it, if the system is not already running Ubuntu.

    - Once Ubuntu is installed, further installations include installing *GnuRadio* and then the spectrometer program from Github.

    - After installation, the computer will be able to run the telescope system directly.

    - Click [here](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/BuildingHorn_SoftwareInfo) for installation instructions.

3. Install the spectrometer program on a Raspberry Pi.

    - This can be done, but the details have not been fully worked out by us (the DSPIRA group). 

    - Details to follow.
