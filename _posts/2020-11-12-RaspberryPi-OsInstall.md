Radio Astronomy with Raspberry Operating System
Glen Langston,  2020 October 21

This document describes the Operating System provided by our research group for Raspberry Pis computers configured for Science Aficionado Radio Astronomy.    The Operating System (OS) is courtesy of nearly countless volunteers in the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the Ubuntu Organization, the GnuRadio Collaboration and the folks at SDRplay.  The GnuRadio Collaboration made home radio astronomy possible, thanks to their free software for digital signal processing.   The community of volunteers have been very helpful in creating a fun to use package for learning the fundamentals of modern communications.    The SDRplay company put together the basis of the OS package including GnuRadio, in order to ease testing of their RSP1A for numerous applications.

The notes here describe only my additions and some hints on setting up networks of radio telescopes, with precise time (hopefully with time tags correct to roughly a microsecond).
Purpose
The goal of this project is to enable everyone to discover that our Milky Way Galaxy surrounds us and is visible day and night, with your own home-built radio telescope.    Figure 1 (below) shows our location in the Milky Way and some calibrated observations, like those you will make.  There are several steps involved to get to this point. This document is intended to get you to this level of observations in about a week's work, after youâ€™ve gathered/constructed all the parts.
