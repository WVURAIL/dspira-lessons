In a horn telescope the horn-can combination together act as the antenna. The metal wire probe in the can picks up the radio waves that are guided to it by the horn. The horn is a conducting surface that is arranged in a geometry that optimizes the radio signal detection by the wire probe. Any conducting surface in the desired shape will work.

The horn panels used in the telescope described here are cheap and easy to work with. However, any conducting horn-can combination with the geometry described here will work as a horn telescope.

Other horn designs are listed here {need link}.
