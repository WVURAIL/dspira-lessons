The ultimate goal of the DSPIRA Astronomy Lessons Module is to give the teachers and students an opportunity to actually make observations in the sky using the DSPIRA Radio Horn Telescope.  If you are starting from ground zero in this discipline, then they will need to develop some basic tools, whether it is where to look in your hometown skies, to understanding what electromagnetic radiation is and what can we learn from it.

   The first two activities center around the Nature of Light...
   
## 1. Introduction to the ElectroMagnetic Spectrum  

This is an introductory activity to get the students to dig around the internet to fill out information on the full EM Spectrum.

## 2. The Doppler Effect

Doppler Effect lessons and activities are common, but this DSPIRA lesson actually uses data received by DSPIRA teachers using radio telescopes.

## 3. Understanding Celestial Coordinate Systems

The next activities are to help the user get familiar with how we divide up the sky into different coordinate systems, and how we can use our location and knowledge of the coordinate systems to find our way around the sky for making observaations.

The following are videos from Dr. Loren Anderson from West Virginia University's Astronomy department.  
They are short clips from the his 2nd lecture given to the DSPIRA Teachers during July 2019.
