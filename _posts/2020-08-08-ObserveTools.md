The ultimate goal of the DSPIRA Astronomy Lessons Module is to give the teachers and students an opportunity to actually make observations in the sky using the DSPIRA Radio Horn Telescope.  If you are starting from ground zero in this discipline, then they will need to develop some basic tools, whether it is where to look in your hometown skies, to understanding what electromagnetic radiation is and what can we learn from it.

**_Activity List_**
   1. Introduction to the ElectroMagnetic Spectrum
   2. The Doppler Effect
   3. Understanding Celestial Coordinate Systems
   4. Observing Celestial Coordinate Systems using Stellarium
   5. Introduction to Radio Astronomy
   
## 1. Introduction to the ElectroMagnetic Spectrum  

This is an introductory activity to get the students to dig around the internet to fill out information on the full EM Spectrum.

## 2. The Doppler Effect

Doppler Effect lessons and activities are common, but this DSPIRA lesson actually uses data received by DSPIRA teachers using radio telescopes.

## 3. Using Stellarium to Find the Galactic Center

This is more closely related to the Earth Motion Lesson sequence, but would be a good starter for making observations in the sky.

**STELLARIUM NOTE:** First off, Stellarium is not the only planetarium software available, but it is the one that was used with the DSPIRA Teacher program, and the one being utilized with these activities.  
**USE DOWNLOAD VERSION** If you are at this point investigating the Milky Way with the Horn Telescope (or at least heading in that direction) You should have a few versions downloaded on computers you intend on using. It will make the student's observation planning much easier.

## 4. Introduction to the Milky Way - What can we see?

Just a basic chance for the students to get basic information about the Milky Way off the internet. There is also a first pass at understanding the Galactic Coordinate system used for studying the Milky Way.

## 5. Introduction to the Milky Way - What CAN'T we see? 

The name is hopefully not misleading, because there is lots that we can't see.  This activity looks at MOTION as "the thing we can't see" (without understanding the [Doppler Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4OnBYrbCjY))

## 6. Modeling the Motion of the Milky Way

This is a paper model that allows the students to determine relative radial speeds of stars at locations around the Milky Way Galaxy.  A collaborative class effort can produce a model very similar to current research in Milky Way Astronomy

## 7. Creating a Velocity Curve for the Milky Way Galaxy
This is a culminating activity that the teachers and students can take on collecting data of the galaxy... If you go back to the Lesson Module Page, there is a complete other lesson sequence to accomplish this.
