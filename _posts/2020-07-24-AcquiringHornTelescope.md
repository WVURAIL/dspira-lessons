##Options for Acquiring a Horn Telescope
Different options for acquiring a working system to operate a horn radio telescope are presented below. Links to documentation and instructional videos are provided where applicable.

1. Assemble a complete system
   - the horn & antenna can assembly – see Building a Horn Telescope link

      * the antenna can
      * the antenna probe
      * the antenna feedthrough

   - a low noise amplifier (LNA)
       All of these will work. The DSPIRA LNA is the most stable and long lasting.

      * Best option: the DSPIRA LNA – see information and instructions [link]
      * Next best option: [Nooelec SAWbird+ H1](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-addons/sawbird-h1.html) - Premium SAW Filter & Cascaded Ultra-Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) Module for Hydrogen Line (21cm) Applications
      * Next best option: [Radio Astronomy Hydrogen Line Low Noise Amplifier](https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/radio-astronomy-hydrogen-line-low-noise-amplifier/) 

   - an Airspy Software Defined Radio: [Airspy R2](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2) 
   - coaxial cable with SMA connectors: from coaxrf.com, [LMR195 SMA MALE to SMA MALE Coaxial RF Pigtail Cable](https://www.coaxrf.com/shop/1-rf-coaxial-cables/times-microwave-lmr195/sma-male-times-microwave-lmr195/lmr195-sma-male-to-sma-male-coaxial-rf-pigtail-cable-2/)
   - computer
   - *Gnuradio* open source program
   - *spectrometer_w_cal.grc* program from the Github gr-radio_astro repository

2. Assemble the horn & electronics and use a thumb drive to run the software from any computer
   - the horn & antenna can assembly – see [Building a Horn Telescope link]
