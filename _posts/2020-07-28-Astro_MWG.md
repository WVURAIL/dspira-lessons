At the heart of the DSPIRA Experience is the development of the Radio Horn Telescope. It is truly amazing that we can built a low cost device that can reveals secrets from Radio Waves in space.  However, like a starter telescope purchased at a department store can't see all the wonders that the Hubble Space Telescope can, the DSPIRA Horn Telescope will only be able to detect the brightest radio sources.

It turns that the brightest radio source is the Milky Way Galaxy, and that is what the DSPIRA Horn Telescope will be detecting, so this little activity/lesson sequence will introduce the Milky Way and lead us to what the radio waves will reveal.
