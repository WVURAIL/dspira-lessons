###### *DSPIRA Summer Session - July 2019 - Green Bank, West Virginia*

At the heart of the DSPIRA Experience is the development of the Radio Horn Telescope. It is truly amazing that we can built a low cost device that can reveals secrets from Radio Waves in space.  However, like a starter telescope purchased at a department store can't see all the wonders that the Hubble Space Telescope can, the DSPIRA Horn Telescope will only be able to detect the brightest radio sources.

It turns that the brightest radio source is the Milky Way Galaxy, and that is what the DSPIRA Horn Telescope will be detecting, so this little activity/lesson sequence will introduce the Milky Way and lead us to what the radio waves will reveal.

**_Activity List_**
   1. How Fast Are We Moving?
   2. Celestial Coordinate Systems
   3. Using Stellarium to Find the Galactic Center
   4. Introduction to the Milky Way - What can we see?
   5. Introduction to the Milky Way - What CAN'T we see?
   6. A Model of the Motion within the Milky Way
   7. Getting your own data with your Radio Horn
   
## 1. How Fast Are We Moving?   

This activity may have already been done as a stand alone, or as part of the Earthâ€™s Motion sequence. It does have the students determine the speed of the Sun around the Milky Way, so they can do it now, or recall the value from earlier work.

## 2. Understanding Celestial Coordinate Systems

If the students are heading towards making observations from their location, a basic lesson of coordinate systems is needed.  Galactic Coordinates are covered here.

This, too, is a separate stand alone lesson within this DSPIRA space.

## 3. Using Stellarium to Find the Galactic Center

This is more closely related to the Earth Motion Lesson sequence, but would be a good starter for making observations in the sky.

**STELLARIUM NOTE:** First off, Stellarium is not the only planetarium software available, but it is the one that was used with the DSPIRA Teacher program, and the one being utilized with these activities.  
**USE DOWNLOAD VERSION** If you are at this point investigating the Milky Way with the Horn Telescope (or at least heading in that direction) You should have a few versions downloaded on computers you intend on using. It will make the student's observation planning much easier.

## 4. Introduction to the Milky Way - What can we see?

Just a basic chance for the students to get basic information about the Milky Way off the internet. There is also a first pass at understanding the Galactic Coordinate system used for studying the Milky Way.  

## 5. Introduction to the Milky Way - What CAN'T we see? 

The name is hopefully not misleading, because there is lots that we can't see.  This activity looks at MOTION as "the thing we can't see" (without understanding the [Doppler Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4OnBYrbCjY))
