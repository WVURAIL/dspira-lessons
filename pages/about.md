<h2>Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy</h2>

<div>
    <p class="major">
        Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA) is an NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and
        Computer Science Site at the West Virginia University Lane Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The Principal
        Investigators are Professors Natalia Schmid and Kevin Bandura. The GBO coordinator is Richard Prestage

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The West Virginia University (WVU) Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, the WVU Center for Gravitational
        Waves and Cosmology, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, WV, have been funded to develop
        a Research Experience for Teachers program: "Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA)". This RET program
        will provide high school teachers with hands on experience using high quality open source software development tools,
        in both research engineering and educational settings. Through a six week summer program, and academic year follow-up,
        the teachers will gain experience in the engineering method, via involvement in the research, design, development,
        and prototyping of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and applications targeted for the next generation of
        radio telescopes. Teachers will work in small groups to complete one of two research projects, which they will continue
        with interested students. In addition, teachers will collaborate with project staff to develop DSP classroom projects
        that involve an entire classroom of students in DSP activities. DSPIRA will engage three cohorts, each composed of
        ten high school teachers, two graduate students, and undergraduate students, in a shared learning community, over
        the three year course of the project. DSPIRA aims to: (1) Prepare teachers to implement DSP projects with their students,
        exposing them to exciting STEM career opportunities; (2) Inspire high school students to pursue careers in STEM disciplines;
        (3) Broaden the reach of the DSP activities developed through DSPIRA, and (4) Develop the communication / pedagogical
        skills of the teachers, project staff, graduate and undergraduate students.
