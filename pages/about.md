    <p class="major">
        Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA) is an NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and
        Computer Science Site at the West Virginia University Lane Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
    </p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The West Virginia University (WVU) Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, the WVU Center for Gravitational
        Waves and Cosmology, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, WV, have been funded to develop
        a Research Experience for Teachers program: "Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA)". This program providedands on experience using high quality open source software development tools,
        in both research engineering and educational settings. This program was a six week summer program. Invlovemnet continued remotely. 
        The teachers were given experience in the engineering method, via involvement in the research, design, development,
        and prototyping of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and applications targeted for the next generation of
        radio telescopes.
