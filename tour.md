Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA) is an NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the West Virginia University Lane Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Check out this short video for a quick introduction to DSPIRA

As explained in the video this program was designed to be provide teachers the training and materials in the field of Radio Astronomy. This acts as a stepping stone for an eclectic journey through science and engineering with the given context in Astronomy. The culmination of this program are lessons and exercises designed by the participating cohort of teachers themselves. These lessons involve all aspects of Radio astronomy from building a radio telescope  to its operation:

A horn telescope, which consists of 3 major parts: the **antenna**, the **support stand**, and the **back-end electronics**, is easy to build. The cost is only a few hundred dollars. Click here for detailed instructions for constructing a horn telescope.

Additionally we have several lesson in Astronomy to work on with or without these telescopes:

The radio horn telescope to be used for some basic observation and research that could be done at the high school level, or for enthusiast hobbyists. CLick here to access the Astronomy Module, which delves into the topics within astronomy that can be investigated using a horn telescope.  

All of the modules are organised in this page:
