**Overview of Telescope Design** 

*  The horn telescope is designed as an ‘optimal’ horn, constructed from 1 gallon square paint thinner can and aluminized insulation board.

* The cradle provides a frame for the horn to be easily connected to any support stand of your choice. The cradle design presented here provides an ability for the horn to rotate on an axis for easy elevation angle control.

* The cradle can be connected to any base desired. The wooden support stand presented here provides sturdy support for the horn. It is a simple design that is affordable and easy to construct. Its largest dimension is 75 cm so that it just fits through a standard doorway.

* The horn telescope presented here is designed to be affordable and easily constructed using materials that can be obtained mostly from a local home improvement store.
