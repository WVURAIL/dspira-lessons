***Note: These lessons were constructed using GNURadio 3.8. They should be able to be done on different versions of GNURadio, but be aware that there might be slight differences in some of the blocks.

**A. Introduction to GNURadio and Some Basic DSP**

* These are the lessons that appear on the [Build a Simple Spectrometer](https://wvurail.org//dspira-lessons/Simple_Spectrometer) page.

    - [Lesson 1](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/FilesUploaded/Gnuradio_Lesson1_simpleWaveform.pdf) - Introduction to GNURadio basics.
    - [Lesson 2](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/FilesUploaded/Gnuradio_Lesson2_MultipleSources.pdf) - Learning more GNURadio tools building a multiple waveform source.
    - [Lesson 3](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/FilesUploaded/Gnuradio_Lesson3_FourierSeries.pdf) - Demonstration of Fourier series.
    - [Lesson 4](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/FilesUploaded/Gnuradio_Lesson4_FFT.pdf) - Demonstration of how an FFT block works.
    - [Lesson 5](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/FilesUploaded/Gnuradio_Lesson5_Filters.pdf) - Filter basics.
