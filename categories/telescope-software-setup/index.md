**Overview of Telescope Design** 

* The horn telescope uses software defined radio (SDR) for collecting and processing the radio signals collected.

* An SDR dongle is needed for this system. See the [SDR Options page.](https://wvurail.org//dspira-lessons/SDR)

* This telescope system uses the free, open-source software *GNURadio*. Options for acquiring this program are provided below.

* Instructions for building a simple spectrometer in *GNURadio* are provided here.

* The spectrometer program built and developed by DSPIRA is called `spectrometer_w_cal.grc`. Instructions for installing this program are also provided here. 


**Software N for the Horn Telescope:**

1. **Acquire Necessary Software:**

* [Installation on a Bootable Flashdrive](){: .button} - All of the software needs to operate the telescope are loaded onto a bootable flashdrive, including GNURadio and the `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` program, are provided here.

* [Installation of Ubuntu and SDR software on a computer](){: .button} - Steps for installing the linux OS Ubuntu on a computer, loading *GNURadio*, and the `spectrometer_w_cal.grc` program are provided here.

2. [**Simple Spectrometer**](https://wvurail.org//dspira-lessons/???){: .button} - Build a simple spectrometer in GNURadio for the telescope.
