* This telescope system uses the free, open-source software *Gnuradio*. Options for acquiring this program are provided below.

* Instructions for building a simple spectrometer in *Gnuradio* are provided here.

* The spectrometer program built and developed by DSPIRA is called *spectrometer_w_cal.grc*. Instructions for installing this program are also provided here.
