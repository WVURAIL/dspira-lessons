Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA) is an NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the West Virginia University Lane Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Check out this short video for a quick introduction to DSPIRA

As explained in the video this program was designed to be provide teachers the training and materials in the field of Radio Astronomy. This acts as a stepping stone for an eclectic journey through science and engineering with the given context in Astronomy. The culmination of this program are lessons and exercises designed by the participating cohort of teachers themselves. These lessons involve all aspects of Radio astronomy from building a radio telescope  to its operation:

A horn telescope, which consists of 3 major parts: the **antenna**, the **support stand**, and the **back-end electronics**, is easy to build. The cost is only a few hundred dollars. Click here for detailed instructions for constructing a horn telescope.

# Lightwork memo series: Many hands make light work

The LightWork Memo series is an informal series of numbered memoranda on topics related to Citizen Science with Radio Telescopes.

This series is intended to encourage the public in the United States, and throughout the world, to collaborate on the design, construction and operation of Radio Telescopes for the purpose of furthering science, engineering and education. The creation of a memo series is motivated by the success that a focused memo series can have on organizing design and construction of large astronomical facilities.

# Request a Radio Telescope kit

If you are an educator or a community organizer enthusiastic about radio astornomy and are slowed down by access to equipment such as SDR dongles and 21cm LNAs you can fill out the following form to request a starter kit. We can ship them to you until supplies last. Please fill within the form your shipment details and your tentative plans or the work you have conducted with your students/community.
